                        <h2>Design Context</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Greendale Community Trust contacted me in 2020
                            after completing work for them the previous year
                            through my high school. They asked me to complete
                            the work I started on the website I created for
                            them. I volunteered to do this as I wanted to give
                            back to the local community and get some more
                            experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The trust's mission is to provide funding for the
                            maintenance, repair, restoration and improvement of
                            buildings, structures, facilities and places of
                            historical interest, public amenity or recreational
                            benefit in the district of Greendale, Canterbury.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The trust has undertaken many projects, including
                            the T W Adams Arboretum. The Arboretum is a site of
                            national historical significance, containing many
                            unique tree specimens planted by T W Adams. In
                            conjunction with the School of Forestry, the trust
                            has undertaken the restoration of the Arboretum,
                            including tree surgery, fencing and general upkeep
                            of the site. The trust has added a walkway as part
                            of the restoration, allowing locals to walk through
                            the Arboretum. QR codes have been added to the trees
                            throughout the Arboretum to enable visitors to read
                            more about the trees. Therefore the trust required
                            someone to produce a website that allows users to
                            view tree details and learn more about the trust.

                        <h2>Design Requirements / Specifications</h2>
                        <p>
                            From an initial meeting, I learnt the website must
                            do the following things:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Provide a home page for the Greendale Community
                                Trust, allowing visitors to learn more about
                                their work.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Provide an effective way for visitors to see and
                                learn more about all the tree's in the
                                Arboretum.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Allow a visitor to view a specific tree after
                                scanning its QR code.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Allow a visitor to report damage to any tree in
                                the Arboretum.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Allow an administrator to add, edit, and remove
                                trees and damage reports.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            I decided that the best way to achieve these goals
                            was to create a dynamic website that pulls
                            information from a database. The QR codes placed on
                            trees would encode a link that contained a unique id
                            for the individual tree and provide a page to view
                            all the trees and search for a specific tree.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I would provide a form on the user-facing site to
                            allow visitors to report damage to any trees. I also
                            created an admin panel that would contain all the
                            functionality that the administrator would require.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Front End Design</h2>
                        <p>
                            For the front end design, I tried to keep the design
                            as simplistic as possible while still adding some
                            visual flair. My reasoning for this was two-fold.
                            Firstly, it allowed me to move on to the backend
                            quickly. Secondly, and most importantly, a simple
                            design meant that broad browser capability was easy
                            to achieve. I set myself a goal of having this
                            website supporting all major web browsers down to
                            IE10. Broad browser compatibility was a unique
                            challenge for me. I started learning about web
                            design in 2016 when flexbox had been widely
                            established and supported, and table/float based
                            layouts only existed in nightmares or compatibility
                            conscious individuals. The final design for the
                            home, Arboretum, and specific tree pages can be seen
                            below in Figures 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

                        <p>
                            For the backend, I decided to use PHP as I have
                            experience from high school, and it has a good
                            library ecosystem and provided a friendly interface
                            for executing SQL. I used PHP to read and process
                            form contents when the user submitted. I also used
                            PHP to query the database to populate the Arboretum
                            page and specific tree pages. The design of the
                            login panel, admin panel, and edit page can be seen
                            in Figures 4, 5, and 6, respectively.

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>
                            Overall, this project allowed me to learn a lot
                            about creating a website with complex functionality
                            from start to finish. This project was also the
                            first time I had published a website and introduced
                            me to new issues, such as namespace configuration
                            and SSL certification. In retrospect, I would do
                            many things differently for both the front and back
                            end. For example, I would probably utilise salting
                            for the user passwords to add extra security. I
                            would also use a PHP framework such as Laravel to
                            accelerate development and provide more elegant
                            image management and manipulation solutions instead
                            of reinventing the wheel.
